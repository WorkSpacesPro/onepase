GoL
===

> "Mathematics is the simple bit. Its cats that are complicated.", John Conway 1970

Game of Life "exists" in an infinite two-dimensional

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
[interactive example](http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/)

How to go about it
==================

It is not necessary to see to believe (although it surely helps!).
  - A new game has no cells
  - A new game after a tick ... nothing changes
  - A new game, when I add a new live cell, after a tick the single cell dies alone
  - A game with 3 cells distant from each other (0,0 : 0,10 : 20,20), after a tick, they all die!!

Visualization
=============

Ryan Davis has added a small set of classes to visualize GoL so we can focus on

* **Methods cannot have more than 3 lines**.
* **No conditional statements**. Be creative and find other
* **No primitives** across method boundaries (input or output).  such as arrays, lists or Enumerables.
* **Mute ping-pong pairing**. Like what Aaron and Ryan did only 
* **Object Calisthenics**. You can find even more possible constraints in the

    1. One level of indentation per method
    2. Don’t use the ELSE keyword
    3. Wrap all primitives and Strings
    4. First class collections
    5. One dot per line

We will summarize the best constraints
